# Event$

Have you ever tried to plan an event using Facebook? If you have, you'll know that a huge amount of people will list themselves as attendencing but then not actually show up. Even worse, you might be one of those people. If that sounds like you, then Event$ can help encourage you to keep those commitments. Event$ tracks your location and can tell when you don't show up at events you've promised to attend. If you miss an event, Event$ will take some money from your bank account and donate it to a charity of your choice.  

We developed Event$ for HackIllinois, and we used Capitol One's Hackathon API to move the money around. In the future, we would like to switch away from the Hackathon API and use a real bank API so that users can actually transfer money to a real charity.
